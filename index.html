          <p>
            Rómulo Ángel del Monte Carmelo Gallegos Freire
            <i>(2 August 1884 - 5 April 1969)</i> was a Venezuelan novelist and
            politician. For a period of nine months during 1948, he governed as
            the first freely elected president in Venezuela's history. He was
            removed from power by military officers in the 1948 Venezuelan
            coup.<br />
            Rómulo Gallegos is considered the most relevant Venezuelan novelist
            of the 20th century, and a prominent figure in Latin American
            literature.

        <h2>Early life and writings</h2>
        <p id="tribute-info">
          Rómulo Gallegos was born in Caracas to Rómulo Gallegos Osío and Rita
          Freire Guruceaga, into a family of humble origin. He began his work as
          a schoolteacher, writer, classical music enthusiast, and journalist in
          1903. His novel Doña Bárbara was first published in 1929, and it was
          because of the book's criticisms of the regime of longtime dictator
          Juan Vicente Gómez that he was forced to flee the country. He took
          refuge in Spain, where he continued to write: his acclaimed novels
          Cantaclaro (1934) and Canaima (1935) date from this period. He
          returned to Venezuela in 1936 and was appointed Minister of Public
          Education.
        </p>
        <h2>Political career</h2>
        <p>
          In 1937 he was elected to Congress and, in 1940-41, served as Mayor of
          Caracas. In 1945, Rómulo Gallegos was involved in the coup d'état that
          brought Rómulo Betancourt and the "Revolutionary Government Junta" to
          power, in the period known as El Trienio Adeco. In the 1947 general
          election he ran for the presidency of the republic as the Acción
          Democrática candidate and won in what is generally believed to be the
          country's first honest election. He took over 74 percent of the vote,
          still a record for a free election in Venezuela. He took office on
          February 15, and was noted for raising the state's tax revenue for oil
          profits increase from 43% to 50%, a tax scheme known as "fifty /
          fifty" and which was subsequently replicated in several oil producing
          countries such as Saudi Arabia. President Gallegos initiated the
          implementation of an “open-door” policy, which sparked an influx of
          Italians, eventually becoming the largest European population group
          within Venezuela. Nevertheless, army officers Carlos Delgado Chalbaud,
          Marcos Pérez Jiménez and Luis Felipe Llovera Páez, threw him out of
          power November in the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état. He took refuge
          first in Cuba and then in Mexico. Gallegos returned to his country
          after the fall of the dictatorship of Marcos Pérez Jiménez in 1958.
          While he was named a senator for life, he no longer took an active
          role in politics. Gallegos was awarded the National Literature Prize
          (1958, for La doncella), and elected to the Venezuelan Academy of the
          Language (the correspondent agency in Venezuela of the Spanish Royal
          Academy). From 1960 to 1963, he was a Commissioner of the newly
          created Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (created by OAS in
          Washington on 18 August 1959), and he was also its first President
          (1960) a position he held until 1963.

        <h2>Accolades</h2>
        <p>
          He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1960, largely
          due to the efforts of Miguel Otero Silva, and gained widespread
          support in Latin America, but ultimately lost out to Saint-John Perse.
          The Rómulo Gallegos International Novel Prize was created in his honor
          on 6 August 1964 by a presidential decree, enacted by Venezuelan
          president Raúl Leoni. The declared purpose of the prize is to
          "perpetuate and honor the work of the eminent novelist and also to
          stimulate the creative activity of Spanish language writers." It is
          awarded by the government of Venezuela, through the offices of the
          Rómulo Gallegos Center for Latin American Studies (Celarg). The first
          prize was given in 1967. It was awarded every five years until 1987,
          when it became a biannual award. The award includes a cash prize of
          €100,000 making it among the richest literary prizes in the world.
